# Overview

This file will have the decisions made around the behaviour of the product

## API version

In order to follow the product strictly I chose not to version the API.

## Testing

As there were no other services running, no mocking was needed in order to test the application successfully.

Try to use unit test to cover all the code and possible problems

Use the Vegeta tool to test load tests

## Time

Since it's a short time project, everything it will be simple
