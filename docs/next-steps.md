# Overview

This document will document the product next steps.

## API version

This product should have a versioned API in order to have more flexibility when providing the API to clients.

## CI/CD

Create a docker image in order to run the application

## Monitoring

There should exist some monitoring such as alerts and dashboards to check for the application's health. Examples of these alerts could be like 1 5xx error, a dashboard with the activity of the system would also be valuable to assess the architecture, should this be a microservice or a lambda.

Improve logs

## Testing

Testing should be improved with load testing to ensure the application could stand high traffic and integration tests to test all flow

## Architecture

A diagram with the architecture of the application would be very valuable to onboard new people, as it stands and no interactions exist it is no needed.

## Docs

Improve documentation and add an API collection for Postman
